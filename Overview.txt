- Roots in C family
- Similarites to JS and Java
- Nearly all backwards compatible with current compiler
- For .Net applicaiton

IDE's
- Visual Studio
- .Net CLI and VSC

- Build Tab > Build Solution

- .exe file contains the application

Debugger 
- Click in grey area on left hand side to create a breakpoint
	- Application halts at break point to inspect
	-Highlights code in red
- When running code, hits breakpoint, can hover over code in editor to inspect
- Click continue (same place as run) to continue running code after break points
- Use breakpoints and stepover button to go line by line thru code after breakpoints

Dotnet SDK
- dotnet new creates a new project
- dotnet build compiles the application
- dotnet run executes
- dotnet new console -n "NameOfApp"
