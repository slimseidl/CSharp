- Roots in C family
- Similarites to JS and Java
- Nearly all backwards compatible with current compiler
- For .Net applicaiton

IDE's
- Visual Studio
- .Net CLI and VSC
- JetBrains Ryder

Visual Studio 2022
- Projects are containers for code files
- Compiled into executable files
- Can use templates to get started
- Console Applications Template

Syntax
- Console.WriteLine ("Text")
	- Writes output to console app
- Semicolon terminates a line / new line
- string name = console.readline(); 
	- initializing a string variable with input from user

Building
- Building compiles the code without executing
- Build Tab > Build Solution

- .exe file contains the application

Debugger 
- Click in grey area on left hand side to create a breakpoint
	- Application halts at break point to inspect
	-Highlights code in red
- When running code, hits breakpoint, can hover over code in editor to inspect
- Click continue (same place as run) to continue running code after break points
- Use breakpoints and stepover button to go line by line thru code after breakpoints

Dotnet SDK
- dotnet new creates a new project
- dotnet build compiles the application
- dotnet run executes
- dotnet new console -n "NameOfApp"
	- new = new 
	- console = application template type
	- -n allows naming
	- "Name of App goes between quotes"
VS code
- All the dotnet CLI things work with VS Code, may prefer this over visual studio 2022
- dotnet new app (console) -n "Name" 
	- How to build a new project 
- C# Dev Kit in VS Code
	- Allows users to do more things inside VS code versus using the console
- CTRL + SHIFT + P to open command pallete
- Type in Run or Build 
- Can create keyboard shortcuts to execute commands

Projects and Solutions
- Solution is a container that houses Projects
	- .sln files 
	- Organizes components 
	- .sln files do not contain code 
	- tells the IDEA which project files belong together
- Project is fundamental building block in .NET 
	- Contains actual code files (.cs)
