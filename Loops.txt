Loops
- for loop (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	- int i = 0
		- initialization of variable to compare to
	- i < 10
		- Condition statement
		- Loop executes while condition is valid
	- i++
		- modifier
		- increases the value of i after every iteration
- Foreach loops
	- foreach (var number in numbers)
	- iterates over values in a list, array or dictionary
While loops
	while condition is valid it executes
	while (i < 10)
Do While
	- always executes once
	- do is first, condition at end of loop

	Break - jumps out of loop
	Continue - jumps to next iteration
