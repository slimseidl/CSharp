Methods
- Methods help with reusability of code
- Often contain parameters that are passed, like a function in python
- Must have a method name, followed by a () for parameters
	- methodName (x)
- Must have a body
	- methodName(x)
		{
		body
		}
- Return type
	- what the method should return for a value
		- may not have a return value
		- void return type
- can have an access modifier
	-where the method can be invoked
-Example
	methodName(x, y)
-Public - Publicly available method
	public int addTwoNumbers (int a, int b)
	{return a + b}
	//int is the return type
